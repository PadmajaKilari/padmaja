        <h1>My Favorite place <br>Ooty</h1>

        <p>The popular hill station Ooty is a shorter derivation from its original name Udhagamandalam, sometimes called
            Ootacamund. During earlier times it was also called OttaikalMandu. The charm and beauty of this hill station
            in Nilgiri hills calls for the name it got, ‘The Queen of Hill Stations’. It is called a nature lover’s
            paradise too, due to its greens, wonderful blue Mountains, rippling clear lakes, alpine woods and lively
            climate like that of English summers.</p>
